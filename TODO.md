- a simple arduino logger class to wrap diagnostic outputs
- motor mapping to a RC channel
- verify quaternion orientation
- unit conversions to the GP interface
  - orientation
  - location
  - velocity
- safety checks pre-arm -- to ensure the mode flip is safe and 
  - rc failsafe
  - rc disarm
- the mcp override flip doesn't seem to be logged -- or isn't displayed
- some sort of flight log in spi flash
